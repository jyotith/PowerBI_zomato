Description

Zomato is a restaurant aggregation and meal delivery service based in India. It is currently operating in several countries across the world. Zomato provides thorough information about numerous eateries as well as consumer reviews. Zomato's owners aim to find hidden irregularities in their company's data. The ultimate goal of this project is to examine the data in such a way that they can accurately assess their business performance.

The data (sample) is currently accessible in the form of a few Excel files, each of which contains information about multiple restaurants operating in a certain continent. The clients want to construct a consolidated and interactive Power BI report that will allow them to do the following:

    Derive data on the total number of restaurants worldwide, including continents, countries, and cities

    View data on a global scale with the capacity to drill down to a granular level

    Derive data on the restaurants with the highest average customer ratings

    Discover the restaurants with the lowest average costs

Filter and view information on the restaurants based on:
o Their geographical dimensions such as continent, country, and city.
o The service they provide, such as online ordering or reservation services.
o The average rating slab by color.
• Identify the restaurants with the most cuisines served.
• Design a multi-page report that suits Zomato's theme with easy navigation across 
sections.
• Allow Zomato users to be able to access this information from both a web 
browser and a mobile device

Import the data from all available excel files.
2. Transform data.
3. Remove any columns that aren't being used.
4. Create two columns to display the restaurant name and restaurant 
address.
5. Make a separate table for the list of the cuisines that each restaurant 
serves.
6. As it's a dimension table, the country-code table must only include 
unique and non-blank values
